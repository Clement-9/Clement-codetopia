# New Tags Learned
I learnt about the <div> tag which is used for grouping content
I also learnt anout the <a> tag together with the target="_blank" which opens a link in a new tab
The * is used in CSS to apply style to all elements in the HTML.
The "box-shadow" css property creates a shadow effect.

#Color Scheme Choices
Background-color: rgb(6, 6, 82);
City-description: #8c8c8c
Some parts also had white text.

# Reason For Choice of City
