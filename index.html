      <h2>Paris - France</h2>

      <p class="description">Paris, the capital of France, is a global epicenter of art, fashion, gastronomy, and culture.
         Known as the "City of Light," it is celebrated for its breathtaking architecture, from the iconic Eiffel Tower 
         and Gothic Notre-Dame Cathedral to its grand boulevards and intimate cobblestone streets.
